I am a __Ph.D. student in computer science__ at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working under Prof. Stephanie Schuckers. My research focuses on biometrics, with ongoing projects in 3D face mask generation, deepfake identity preservation, and voice biometrics under noisy conditions. I am actively involved with the [Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR)](https://citer.clarkson.edu/), a multi-university research consortium focused on advancing biometric security. I have hands-on experience with deep learning models for speech enhancement (e.g., Wave-U-Net, U-Net, CMGAN), 3D face reconstruction, and synthetic biometric data generation using GANs. Iâ€™m passionate about developing robust, explainable AI systems for biometric security and have published in IEEE EMBC, IEEE Dataport, Global Journal, BES Journal, and the Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy. I completed an M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Clarkson University, NY.
